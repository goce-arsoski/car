# Car

Welcome to my first project! With this gem you can drive (accelerate & decelerate) and shutt off the car, also you can change the color of your car. First at all you need to initialize your car (year, color, brand and model) and folow the instruction below.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

gem 'car'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install car

## Usage

In this gem you can change color of your car, and you can only read year, brand and model.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
